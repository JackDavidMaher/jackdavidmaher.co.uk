        Penzance to Lamorna Cove – Why This South West Coast Path Stretch Belongs On Your List

        Stretch your legs and explore the rugged beauty of the Cornish Coast on this impressive stretch of the South West Path. Keep reading to discover why Penzance to Lamorna Cove is one of the best South West Coast Path walks in Cornwall, or check out other great walks in the area in our blog The best Salt Path Walks. 
        Route Overview: Distance, Difficulty and Highlights

        Covering just under six miles in total, walking from Hotel Penzance to Lamorna Cove is a challenging yet manageable way to spend a day exploring the coast. 

        The stretch from Penzance to Mousehole lets you find your stride, enjoying a gentle amble along the seafront, before you take things up a notch on the more challenging stretch from Mousehole to Lamorna. Here, the path becomes more undulating with rocky sections underfoot. 

        The walk only takes around two and a half to three hours to complete, but with stops for refreshments or even lunch, and time to soak up the stunning views at Kemyel Crease and Penzer Point, its easy to make a day of it. 

        There are numerous cafes in Mousehole where you can enjoy a drink and a slice of cake, while the café at Lamorna Cove is famous for its crab specialities and Cornish cream tea. 
        Stage 1: Penzance to Newlyn to Mousehole 

        The first section of the walk takes you from Penzance through Newlyn and on into Mousehole, a charming seaside village brimming with traditional Cornish character. 

        Youll head south past the docks and South Pier and round Battery Rocks, before taking the path towards Newlyn. Youll pass Wherrytown beach, backed by Newlyn Green and the Newlyn Art Gallery, should you wish to make an arty detour, and the Bolitho Gardens before reaching Newlyn.

        In Newlyn, youll see yachts and fishing boats bobbing in the water along Mounts Bay, but the town is also home to an art gallery and a good selection of pubs and restaurants if you need refreshments. 

        As you leave Newlyn, youll pass the lighthouse to Penlee Point before coming into Mousehole, a picturesque fishing village with a lovely harbour and sandy beach. Mousehole is also home to several art galleries, gift shops, cafés, and pubs, so you can have a pitstop before continuing to Lamorna Cove.
        Stage 2: Mousehole to Lamorna Cove 

        As you leave Moushole, the path becomes more challenging with a narrow, rocky single-track path through Kemyel Crease Nature Reserve. With short, steep sections, care is needed, especially near Penzer Point, but the payoff is stunning views of the coastline.

        The path in this section can be muddy and is uneven, so wearing stout footwear is recommended. 

        At just over two miles long, this section is much shorter, but due to the more challenging nature of the path, you should give yourself a good hour to reach Lamorna Cove. 
        Arriving at Lamorna Cove: Facilities, Parking and Safety Notes

        After traversing one of the rockier sections of the South West Path, youll arrive in Lamorna Cove. A hidden gem, it will captivate you with its rugged beauty, dramatic cliffs and crescent-shaped beach. Just be sure to check tide times, so you can make the most of the beach and stay safe.

        Known for its tranquility, there arent many facilities here, but you can get a delicious lunch at Lamorna Cove Café. Originally opened as an ice cream shop in the 1950s, it is now famed for its fresh crab specialties.
        Getting Back: Buses and Simple Returns 

        Although you can walk back the way you came, the M6 runs frequently between Mousehole, Newlyn and Penzance. While a more limited weekday 347 service takes you right to Lamorna village.
        Map, Wayfinding and Route Changes 

        Although the South West Path is well marked with National Trail acorn signposts guiding you along the way, you should also carry an OS map or have the map downloaded on your phone in case you do go off track. Its also helpful should there be any temporary diversion in place en route that you need to navigate around. 

        You can find out more about any planned diversions on the South West Coast Path website.  
        Extend Your Day: On to Porthcurno or Inland Stone Circles 

        To extend the walk from Lamorna Cove, continue along the coastal path to Porthcurno, where you can visit the famous Minack Theatre, one of the most magical outdoor theatres in the UK. From here, you can continue further from Porthcurno to Lands End and visit the most westerly point of England. 

        Or if youd prefer to head inland, visit the Merry Maidens, an ancient stone circle dating back to the Stone Age.

        Both options to extend the walk traverse tougher terrain with more rocky sections, so its best to wear stout footwear and take care with your footing. We also recommend researching the best routes on sites like Walking Britain before you set off.
        Where to Stay: Start Strong From Hotel Penzance 

        Hotel Penzance is the ideal base for a walking holiday in Cornwall. With close proximity to the promenade and stunning sea views, our hotel is perfectly positioned for you to make the most of the South West Coast Path in Penzance, as well as offering easy access to bus routes, for point-to-point routes.

        Whats more, at Hotel Penzance, you can relax with a post-walk dip in our heated outdoor pool, before enjoying a sumptuous meal in our restaurant and settling down for the evening in our comfortably appointed rooms.

Spa Facilities Page:

15m Lap Pool

Our 15m lap pool is a great way to get a relaxing full body workout. Two things that don’t often go together. Floating helps ease muscle tension and the water regulates your temperature—so it doesn’t feel like you’re burning calories. 

13m Hydro Pool

Our 13m hydro pool has 10 different stations, each with air jets—including volcanoes. The 34°C water and pressurised bubbles are therapeutic and perfect for easing your muscles. Afterwards you’ll be filled with endorphins and stress free. 

Scandinavian Sauna

The health benefits of saunas are varied, from easing stress and flushing out toxins to improving respiratory issues. A session in our sauna is perfect after a workout in our gym. 

Aromatherapy Steam Room

The essences we use in our steam room are coconut, orange blossom, eucalyptus, and vanilla. Aromatherapy, first pioneered by the ancient Egyptians, is a way of stimulating your limbic system, where smell and memory combine. It calms you, destresses you, relaxes your muscles, and lifts your mood. 

Himalayan Salt Room

Ever felt sleepy after a trip to the beach? It’s the salty air. Halotherapy is the inhalation of microscopic salt particles, easing your respiration, clearing your sinuses, and clearing your mind. If you suffer from allergies or hay fever this is a brilliant way to give yourself relief. 


Ice Room

You’ll find nothing else like this in Torquay. Our ice room is a next level spa experience based on cold therapy, with an ice fountain and beautiful backlit ice wall. The benefits of cold therapy are numerous, from weight loss to improved circulation and overall health. Do you have the courage to give it a go? 

Fully Equipped Gym

Our gym is the ideal place for your workout—with a range of fitness equipment for toning, resistance training, and cardio.  

Bucket Showers

The bucket shower, also known as the contrast shower is an age-old Tyrolean tradition with many health benefits and is considered an effective hydrotherapy treatment.

Traditionally in Nordic countries the best time for taking a bucket shower is immediately after a sauna, because the body is overheated so gets the greatest benefit from the thermal shock.
